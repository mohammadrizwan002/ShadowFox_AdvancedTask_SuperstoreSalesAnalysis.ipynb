# ShadowFox Internship â€“ Python Development (Advanced Level)

## Task Done

- Task Name: Superstore Sales Data Analysis
- File: ShadowFox_AdvancedTask_SuperstoreSalesAnalysis.ipynb

This task was part of the advanced level for the ShadowFox internship. I used a retail sales dataset (Sample - Superstore.csv) and did some data analysis using Python. The goal was to find useful insights from the data using graphs and code.

## What I Did

- First, I cleaned the dataset and converted date columns into proper format.
- Then I created a new column to get the month out of the order date so I could check sales month-wise.
- I calculated the total sales per month and plotted it as a bar chart.
- I also checked total sales based on regions like North, South, East, and West.
- Finally, I grouped data by sub-category and calculated profits to see which one made the most.

I showed all these results using bar charts. I also printed out the best performing month, top region, and most profitable sub-category at the end.

## Note

Everything was done in a single Jupyter Notebook in Colab. This is the final submission for the advanced task under the Python domain for the ShadowFox July 2025 internship.
